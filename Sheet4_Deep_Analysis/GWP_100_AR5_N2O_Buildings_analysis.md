# In-Depth Analysis: N2O Emissions from Buildings

## 1. Full-Series Trend (1970–2024): A Minor and Insignificant Source

Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions from the building sector are a very minor source, showing slow growth from **~3 Mt CO2eq** in 1970 to **~8 Mt CO2eq** in 2024. The overall trend is one of slow, inconsistent growth with no significant acceleration.

## 2. Breakpoint and Trend Analysis

The data shows some volatility, with the growth rate fluctuating over time but always remaining at a very low level. The most recent regime, post-2003, shows a slow but steady growth rate of approximately **0.08**.

The statistical model for the final regime is a simple random walk (`ARIMA(0,1,0)`), and the resulting 10-year forecast is **essentially flat**.

## 3. Conclusions

- **Insignificant Scale:** This emission source is negligible in the national context.
- **No Growth Trend:** The data and the forecast confirm that there is no significant underlying growth trend.
- **Not a Climate Concern:** N2O emissions from the building sector are not a climate policy concern.
