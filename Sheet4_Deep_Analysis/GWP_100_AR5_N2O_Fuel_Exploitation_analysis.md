# In-Depth Analysis: N2O Emissions from Fuel Exploitation

## 1. Full-Series Trend (1970–2024): An Insignificant, Flat-Line Source

Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions from fuel exploitation are, for all practical purposes, a non-source of emissions in India. The data shows a flat line for 54 years, with emissions hovering around **0.15 Mt CO2eq**. The series starts at ~0.13 Mt in 1970 and ends at ~0.16 Mt in 2024.

## 2. Analysis and Conclusions

The underlying data shows no discernible trend. The identified "breakpoints" and "regimes" are simply the model's attempt to find a pattern in what is effectively random statistical noise. The slopes of the various regimes are all effectively zero.

**Conclusion:** This is not a real or meaningful emission source. The data shows no trend and can be disregarded from a policy or climate analysis perspective.
